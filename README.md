I've been working on this to help audit various systems for users that are no longer employed. All system reports are either in CSV or Excel and have either a full name column, first and last name columns, or an ID number. The program tries to find employees that are not in the HR list and will print into an excel file with a worksheet for each system audited. Orange rows are system users that are not located in the HR list and yellow rows are located below orange rows to represent users that are similar and maybe a match but are not exact(a person with a suffix jr is often entered without a suffix in a system, but hr will have it as part of the last name, for instance).
